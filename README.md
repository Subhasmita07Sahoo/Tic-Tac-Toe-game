## Deployed Link:- https://subhasmita07sahoo.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-game/

## Project Overview
This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid with "X" and "O". The goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

This project helps to practice front-end web development skills including DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and game logic implementation.

## Features
- Responsive 3x3 game board that works well on desktop and mobile devices.
- Two-player gameplay with alternating turns.
- Displays the current player’s turn.
- Detects win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals).
- Detects tie games when the board is full without any winner.
- Prevents further moves once the game is over.
- Provides a reset button to start a new game.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game UI.
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design for different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Game logic, event handling, and DOM updates.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Click on any empty cell to place your mark ("X" starts the game).
3. The game will automatically switch turns between Player X and Player O.
4. When a player wins or the game ends in a tie, a message will be displayed.
5. Click the "Restart Game" button to reset and play again.
